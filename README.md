# pytorch-base
This is my base for all future pytorch project.
It contains a training class and a evaluation script.

What is needed to run this:
anaconda for env setup
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch
pip install cnn-finetune
pip install PILLOW
pip install opencv-python
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install tensorboard

(Yes it could have been one line, but this way it easier to see what is needed)
